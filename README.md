# pykami
Python interface to the Kami knowledge representation for biochemical models.

Examples
========

The script `indra_to_kami_example1.py` gives an example of reading a
natural language sentence and representing it in the Kami format.

The script processes the text "MEK2 phosphorylates ERK1 at Thr-202 and Tyr-204"
and creates a JSON file, `indra_to_kami_example.json`, which can be visualized
using the Kami browser app.
